            Ever since I was a kid, my parents always told me that if I loved
            being on the computer so much, why not stop thinking as a user and
            start thinking as the creator. Who would've thought that from that
            moment on I'd develop a passion for science, more specifically,
            computer science. Thank you, mom and dad.

            Years pass by and I am now enrolled at the State University of
            Maring√° where I study computer science. After being at the
            University for these couple of years I've accumulated many
            experiences. Although most of them have marked me in a positive way,
            there are two of which I'll mention because they're the reason why I
            love being involved with what I do. I couldn't imagine myself not
            having software engineering and programming as part of the daily
            routine.

            That being said I am starting to develop a relation with machine
            learning and artificial intelligence. Thus my current thesis on
            pattern recognition, in specific, vehicle detection and
            classification using traffic images. In addition, I am currently
            working with web development at Eureka Labs mostly focused on
            Javascript frameworks such as React and Angular alongside Express
            and Java Spring Boot.
